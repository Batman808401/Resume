### This repo has a domain!
Go to [`edsvel.com`](https://batman808401.github.io/Resume/) to quickly access my GitHUb Pages site.
#### A Brief Summary:
Here lies all the files necessary for this presentation. This repository was created by Edgardo Velazquez in late 2017 to serve as a resume to present GitHub projects in an enthusiastic manner. All images used have been taken from open sources unless if specified as an original work from the author. As of this moment, all stock images are temporary and will inevitably be replaced by original works. As of right now, this pages site only utilizes raw html, css, and javascript without the use of any libraries or tools.
Of course, there will always be more things to add so please do come by every so often to see what is new!
